# Study Tracker Project
### This application uses boundary box classification to detect whether the student in front of the camera is focused in on their work. If a phone is detected, it can be assumed that the student is not fully focused at their work, as it is a source of distraction.

### Objects detected by the application:
- Phone
- Pen
